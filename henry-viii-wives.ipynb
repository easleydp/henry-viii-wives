    "# Visualising the Marital Timeline of Henry VIII\n",
    "\n",
    "The marital timeline of Henry VIII is best visualised as a long first marriage followed by five rapid successive marriages, famously summarised by the mnemonic: \"**Divorced, Beheaded, Died; Divorced, Beheaded, Survived**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "| Wife | Dates of Marriage | Fate | Key Facts & Children |\n",
    "| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n",
    "| **Catherine of Aragon** | Jun 11, 1509 – May 23, 1533 | Divorced (marriage annulled) | Mother of **Mary I**. The marriage was annulled by Thomas Cranmer after the Pope refused Henry's request. |\n",
    "| **Anne Boleyn** | May 28, 1533 – May 17, 1536 | Beheaded | Mother of **Elizabeth I**. Executed at the Tower of London on charges of treason and adultery. |\n",
    "| **Jane Seymour** | May 30, 1536 – Oct 24, 1537 | Died | Died of complications shortly after giving birth to Henry's only legitimate son, **Edward VI**. Henry VIII was buried beside her. |\n",
    "| **Anne of Cleves** | Jan 6, 1540 – Jul 12, 1540 | Divorced (marriage annulled) | The marriage was annulled shortly after a disappointing first meeting. She lived a comfortable, independent life in England and outlived all the other wives. |\n",
    "| **Catherine Howard** | Jul 28, 1540 – Feb 13, 1542 | Beheaded | Cousin of Anne Boleyn. Accused of adultery and treason and subsequently executed at the Tower of London. |\n",
    "| **Katherine Parr** | Jul 12, 1543 – Jan 28, 1547 | Survived (widowed) | Twice widowed before marrying Henry. She became a trusted confidante and outlived the king. |"
